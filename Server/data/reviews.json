    "Review": "Parents need to know that YouTube is a video-sharing site and app, and there are many videos on YouTube that may not be age-appropriate for kids. However, as of 2021, YouTube announced that it's slowly releasing more parental control options within YouTube if a parent sets up a supervised Google account for their kid. There will be three tiers of supervision: Explore (the most restrictive), Explore More, and Most of YouTube (the least restrictive). Kids with supervised accounts won't get personalized ads and can't comment or create. Also, for kids 13â€“17, any content they upload will be private by default, there will be bedtime reminders on by default, and autoplay will be off by default.",
